                       <p style="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid whitesmoke;">You wake up behind the wheel of your now-totaled vehicle and immediately realize that you are
                        alone.
                        You didn’t even see the deer before it smashed into the windshield of your car. Honestly, you
                        aren’t even sure it was a deer with how severe the damage seems to be, but the thought of
                        something else that size wandering the surrounding area is too unnerving to think about. The
                        three friends that occupied your passenger and rear seats have all vanished, leaving you the
                        sole commuter on this road to nowhere.
                        Dazed and looking for clues as to where your friends went, you scope your surroundings and
                        notice you are almost entirely surrounded by woods; Save for the road you came in on and what
                        seems to be a cabin in the distance.</p>

                        option and head towards the cabin.
                        You approach the old wooden building and knock on the remains of its door. As soon as your
                        knuckle makes contact with the wood it slowly creaks open. Seeing this as an invitation, you
                        enter the front room. While there doesn’t seem to be anyone on this floor, there is a staircase
                        on your right. Do you:</p>

                    run until the voices are gone, but that doesn’t mean you’re safe. Even when the morning comes,
                    you are still lost in the woods. One week later the 4 of you are reported missing in the local
                    paper. One year later your disappearances remain a mystery. ENDING: LOST IN THE WOODS</p>
