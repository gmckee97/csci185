                    You didn’t even see the deer before it smashed into the windshield of your car. Honestly, you aren’t even sure it was a deer with how severe the damage seems to be, but the thought of something else that size wandering the surrounding area is too unnerving to think about. The three friends that occupied your passenger and rear seats have all vanished, leaving you the sole commuter on this road to nowhere. (<-- that’s corny as hell and needs a replacement, lmk if yall have one)
                    Dazed and looking for clues as to where your friends went, you scope your surroundings and notice you are almost entirely surrounded by woods; Save for the road you came in on and what seems to be a cabin in the distance.</h2>
